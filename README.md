# alphadiff-dataset
This is a deep learning dataset for cross-version binary code similarity detection. 

## Usage
### Download
In order to clone it, you will need *git-lfs*. You can follow the steps:

1. Install *git-lfs* as noted on [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs#installing-git-lfs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs#installing-git-lfs)

2. git lfs clone https://github.com/twelveand0/alphadiff-dataset.git

### Unzip

1. On **Linux**, you can unzip it by the following commands:
```
>> cd alphadiff-dataset
>> cat cat dataset.z01 dataset.z02 dataset.z03 dataset.z04 dataset.z05 dataset.z06 dataset.z07 dataset.z08 dataset.z09 dataset.zip > complete.zip
>> unzip complete.zip 
>> unzip data.zip
```
  ps: because the original ZIP file is splited into multi-parts, you should first cancatenate the parts in order together.

2. On **Windows**, you can just right-click the *dataset.zip* file and select *extract...*.

3. On **Max**, I have not tried.
